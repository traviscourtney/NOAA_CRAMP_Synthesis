The analysis script synthesizes NOAA Pacific National Coral Reef Monitoring Program to estimate census-based net carbonate budgets and chemistry-based net calcification estimates for 56 coral reef sites following the 2014-2017 global coral bleaching event. The code additionally includes a combined census-based and chemistry-based calcification vulnerability index for each site for managers and policy makers to assess the concern for maintaining calcium carbonate balance as a policy-level indicator. All code and analyses were conducted in R and are summarized in the following publication:
